## Stemming And it's Types for Text Preprocessing 

### Subjects & Challenges:
- Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as a lemma. Stemming is important in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP).
- NLTK has RegexpStemmer class with the help of which we can easily implement Regular Expression Stemmer algorithms. It basically takes a single regular expression and removes any prefix or suffix that matches the expression. Let us see an example
- Snowball Stemmer is a stemming algorithm which is also known as the Porter2 stemming algorithm as it is a better version of the Porter Stemmer since some issues of it were fixed in this stemmer.
